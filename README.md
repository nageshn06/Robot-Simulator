# Robot-Simulator
In this Robot Simulator, a robot will navigate a warehouse (10, 10) from a starting point at (0, 0) to a designated destination at (7, 9) while avoiding obstacles. 
The robot will travel at the speed of 0.1m/s and it will stops for 2 seconds after every movement.
As it moves, the robot checks its intended next position against a predefined list of obstacles. If it detects that the next position would collide with an obstacle, it stops and displays a message indicating the encounter. 
The robotâ€™s movement is visualized in real-time, illustrating its path and the locations of obstacles within the warehouse.
